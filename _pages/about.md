I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a  href='https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/peyman-shahidi'>MIT Sloan</a>. I'm interested in researching the intersection of market and information design, along with labor economics. Recently, I've been studying how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the world.

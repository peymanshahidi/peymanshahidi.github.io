I am currently a second year M.Sc. student of *Economics* at [Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)](https://teias.institute), Khatam University, Tehran, Tehran, Iran.
I have obtained my B.Sc. Major in *Electrical Engineering* and Minor in *Economics* from [Sharif University of Technology (SUT)](http://www.en.sharif.edu), Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

I plan to continue my higher education as a Ph.D. student in *Economics* or *Finance*. My primary fields of interest are applied macroeconomics and public finance. My secondary fields of interest are household finance and corporate finance.

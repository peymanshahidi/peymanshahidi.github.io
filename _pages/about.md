<a href='https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/peyman-shahidi'>Ph.D. Candidate at MIT Sloan</a>

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/peyman-shahidi). Previously, I worked as a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at [UChicago Booth](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Economics from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu).

My research focuses on the interplay between market and information design, labor economics, and industrial organization in digital platforms. More recently, I have begun exploring how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the world.

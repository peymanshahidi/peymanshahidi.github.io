I am Peyman Shahidi, currently a second year M.Sc. student of *Economics* at <a href="https://teias.institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)</a>, Khatam University, Tehran, Iran.
I have obtained my B.Sc. Major in *Electrical Engineering* and Minor in *Economics* from <a href="http://www.en.sharif.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharif University of Technology (SUT)</a>, Tehran, Iran.

I plan to continue my higher education as a Ph.D. student in *Economics* or *Finance*. My primary fields of interest are **applied microeconomics** and **public finance**. I am also interested in topics from **household finance** and **corporate finance**.

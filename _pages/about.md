I am currently a second year M.Sc. student of *Economics* at <a href="https://teias.institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)</a>, Khatam University, Tehran, Tehran, Iran.
I have obtained my B.Sc. Major in *Electrical Engineering* and Minor in *Economics* from <a href="http://www.en.sharif.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharif University of Technology (SUT)</a>, Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

I plan to continue my higher education as a Ph.D. student in *Economics* or *Finance*. My primary fields of interest are applied macroeconomics and public finance. My secondary fields of interest are household finance and corporate finance.

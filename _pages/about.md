I am a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. At Booth, I have been working for <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Budish</a> and <a href="https://anthonyleezhang.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Lee Zhang</a> on projects in the fields of Market Design, Industrial Organization, Market Microstructure, Covid-19 Policy, and Economics of Cryptocurrencies.
I've obtained a M.A. in *Economics* and a B.Sc. in *Electrical Engineering*.

I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics. My primary fields of interest are **market design** and **industrial organization**. I am also interested in topics from **labor economics**, **household finance**, and **economics of cryptocurrencies**.

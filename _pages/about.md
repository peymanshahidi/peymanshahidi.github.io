I am Peyman Shahidi, currently a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant to <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Budish</a> and <a href="https://anthonyleezhang.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Lee Zhang</a> at University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Prior to joining Booth, I obtained a M.A. in *Economics* and a B.Sc. in *Electrical Engineering* from Iran.

I plan to continue my higher education as a Ph.D. student in Economics or Finance. My primary fields of interest are **applied microeconomics** and **household finance**. I am also interested in topics from **corporate finance**.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu) in the [IT Group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/program-overview/it). Formerly, I was a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu) from 2021 to 2023. Prior to joining Booth, I obtained a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and an M.A. in Economics.

My research interests are **market** and **information design** as well as **industrial organization**, with a focus on digital platforms. I have also worked on topics related to **market microstructure**, **household finance**, **labor economics**, and **economics of cryptocurrencies**.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at MIT Sloan. Here's my <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jg983k55bvriqfdm0mxdp/PeymanShahidi_CV.pdf?rlkey=3t8kcev8h4zz6go4slomxyktz&e=1&dl=0'>CV</a>.

<br>

I'm broadly interested in researching the interplay between market and information design as well as labor economics. More recently, I have begun exploring how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the world.

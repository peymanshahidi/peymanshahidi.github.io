I am a Ph.D. student at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu). Previously, I worked as a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at the [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu).

My research focuses on the interplay between market and information design, labor economics, and industrial organization in digital platforms. More recently, I have begun exploring how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world. I have also worked on topics related to market microstructure, household finance, and the economics of cryptocurrencies.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu) in the [IT Group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/program-overview/it). Formerly, I was a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu) from 2021 to 2023. Prior to joining Booth, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.chicagobooth.edu) and my M.A. in Economics from [Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)](https://teias.institute).

My fields of interest are **market** and **information design**, **labor economics**, and **industrial organization** with a focus on economics of digital platforms.

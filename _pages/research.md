- Change in Online Taxi Drivers' Labor Supply: Learning or Price Effect? Evidence from Tapsi. [[Paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/usfjiz2foytynd8/tapsi_draft_application2022.pdf?dl=0) [[Slides]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ekr2eqnptkgv6x2/peyman_tapsi_slides_sep2022_nobuilds.pdf?dl=0)
  - <font size="3.25">Abstract:</font> <font size="3">This paper quantitatively studies the dynamics of online taxi drivers' ride acceptance behavior by exploiting two unique ride dispatching characteristics of Tapsi, an Iranian ride-hailing company. I model drivers' work environment in Tapsi using a continous-time search framework and show how their subjective beliefs about goodness of ride prices, what I call the ``experience'' component, will affect ride acceptance patterns. Currently, I am leveraging Tapsi's surge-pricing mechanism in a regression discontinuity design to decompose the effect of exogenous price shocks on drivers' labor supply into two components: (1) pure price effect, and (2) experience effect. In simulation I show how this decomposition can explain heterogeneous responses to similar ride offers not only from different drivers but also from the same driver at different times.

These codes are the solution of Macroeconomics I course problem set 9. 
In this problem set students are required to calculate half-life and maximum deviation from steady state for a simple RBC model.
Moreover, they are asked to replicate Chapter 5 figures of [David Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics Book](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/advanced-macroeconomics-romer/M9781260185218.html).
The complete model of the economy and the outputs of the codes are accessible in the [HW9 Solution](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zajyamvau4wrps2/pset9-solutions.pdf?dl=0). 
The codes for the problem set can be found from the links provided below.
(These codes are optimized for Matlab.)

excerpt: 'This paper is about the ride acceptance behavior of online taxi drivers. 
Developing a quantitative search model in order to study the strategic ride acceptance behavior of online taxi drivers using a dataset with more than 40 Million observations from "Tap30", an Iranian ride hailing company. Coding in both Python (quantitative model simulations) and Stata (fitting to data).'

In this paper, using a search and matching model, I show how learning of the mean parameter of a normal wage distribution affects the ride acceptance behavior of drivers working in online taxi plat- forms. I show that high expectation regarding the mean value of wage distribution leads drivers to accept fewer rides. Moreover, as time passes by, the belief is corrected and more offers will be accepted. In order to empirically show learning in drivers’ behavior, I use a dataset from Tap30, an Iranian ride hailing company. I run two tests in order to quantitatively measure this effect. First, I check whether more ex- perienced drivers’ acceptance rate rises more sharply compared to that of inexperienced ones. Second, I test whether rejected offers for every accepted proposal in certain time slots of the day shows a pattern of learning for those drivers who are longer active in the market. The first test does not indicate any learnings while the second one shows an effect consistent with the implications of the model. However, the identification of this effect is subject to further analysis.

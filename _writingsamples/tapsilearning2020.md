title: "Change in Online Taxi Drivers' Labor Supply: Learning or Price Effect? Evidence from Tapsi."
collection: writingsamples
permalink: /writingsamples/tapsilearning2020
excerpt: 'I develop a search model that accounts for online taxi drivers' belief about the goodness of ride offer prices in their ride acceptance/rejection behavior. I discuss the properties of a dataset I have acquired form Tapsi, an Iranian ride-hailing company. Using this dataset, I will estimate the probability of ride acceptance for an average driver during different times of a working shift. Furthermore, the dataset allows me to decompose the effect of an exogenous price shock on drivers' ride acceptance patterns into two components: price effect and experience effect. In future steps of this research, the extent that each component determines the short-term labor supply decision of drivers will be quantitatively measured using a regression discontinuity design.'

In this paper, using a search and matching model, I show how allowing for learning of the mean parameter of a normal wage distribution affects the ride acceptance behavior of drivers working in online taxi platforms. I show that higher belief about the current(destination) mean of wage distribution leads to drivers' higher(lower) reservation wage. In this paper, I use a dataset constisting of 68 million recorded ride requests from Tapsi, an Iranian ride-hailing company. In future steps of this research, using this dataset, I am going to measure the ride acceptance probability of an average driver by estimating a single-spell duration model. Then, I will quantitatively measure the short-term labor supply elasticity of drivers. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design, I will decompose the effect of an exogenous price shock on drivers' behavior into two components: pure price effect and experience effect.
